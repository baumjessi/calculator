How to use this calculator

Click here to start calculating! 

This simple and cute calculator can evaluate two-variable math problems using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also 
find the square root of a variable. It can evaluate problems with both positive negative numbers and both integers and floats. You can use the 
backspace button to clear individual digits from variables, or you can use the "clear" button to wipe the entire equation. To enter the variables and operator for your math problem, you can use either the on-screen keys or your computer's keyboard.

Here are the keyboard controls:

Digits 0-9: the numbers along the top of your keyboard
Plus: The "+" & "=" key
Minus: the "-" key
Decimal: the "." key
Equal: the Enter key
Square: the Tab key
Multiply: the "x" key
Divide: the "/" key

Acknowledgments 
The backspace button is from Google Fonts.
